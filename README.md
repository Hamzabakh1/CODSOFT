 # Internship Tasks at CODSOFT

This repository contains the tasks completed during my internship at **CODSOFT**. The tasks involve developing machine learning models for various datasets and use-cases.

## Task 1: Iris Flower Classification
The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: ***Setosa***, ***Versicolor***, and ***Virginica***. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. The objective of this task 
is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.

The Iris dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks.

## Task 2: Sales Prediction Using Python
**Sales prediction** involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into **account various factors** such as advertising expenditure, 
target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection. In businesses that offer products or services, the role of a Data Scientist is crucial for predicting future sales. 
They utilize **machine learning techniques in Python** to**analyze and interpret data**, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By leveraging these predictions, 
businesses can optimize their advertising strategies and maximize sales potential.

## Task 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection
The objective of this task is to build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. 
The steps involved in this task include preprocessing and normalizing the transaction data, handling class imbalance issues, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. 
A classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, is trained to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using metrics like precision, 
recall, and F1-score, and techniques like oversampling or undersampling are considered for improving results.
